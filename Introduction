//java is need for to run the program 
//javac is need for run the compiler
//extension is FileName.java
// The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the runtime environment that allows Java programs to execute on various platforms.
//most structured laanguage is java comapred to other languages 
// jshell is a conceptthat you can write java code in command prompt
// semicon for end of that line 


// if we have jvm we can run java appication if we dont have jvm we cant run java application 
//java is plaform independent it means it can run i any os or hardware what it is inly need it is its only need jvm
// but jvm is Dependent 
//java code coversts into java compiler and that code goes / coverst to byte code and that goes to jvm  and jvm looks for main 
//byte code is .class extension
//you file need to have ,main method and main expect parameters 
//JRE Java RunTime Environment
//JDK 
//JDK have JRE inside and JRE have JVM inside
//java is strongly type language 
//in java language 1st is compilation and tehn after is run
//printlnn in to print in another line

//Datatypes : Primitive data types and Non_primitive types
//Data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold

//Primitive: integer, float, characters , boolean
//integer : int-4bytes, byte=1 byte , short-2 bytes, Long - 8bytes
//char : 2 bytes for char we have to use only single quots ''
//Boolean in java Is only True or false not 0 or 1 like others
//float : 4 bytes
//double : 8 bytes


//Non primitive : String , Arrays , Classes , Interfaces
// String is not a primitive data type it is a class , a string is a sequence of characters
//Arrays is a collection of similar data types
//Classes are blueprints for creating objects
//Interfaces are contracts that classes can implement


// java suports UNICODE not ASCII
// In Java, literals are fixed values that are directly embedded into the code. They represent constant values of primitive data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean values, as well as strings. 
// Here's a breakdown of different types of literals in Java:
// Integer Literals: Represents whole numbers. Examples: 10, -5, 0, 1000.
// Floating-Point Literals: Represent numbers with decimal points. Examples: 3.14, -2.5, 0.0.
// Character Literals: Represent single characters enclosed in single quotes. Examples: 'a', 'Z', '%'.
// Boolean Literals: Represent truth values, either true or false.
// String Literals: Represent sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes. Examples: "Hello", "Java", "123".
// // Null Literal: Represents the absence of a value, denoted by null
