//class is nothing but a blueprint for creating objects
//it defines properties and behaviors that the created objects will have

//Object is an instance of a class
//it is created based on the structure defined by the class
//Objects hold specific values for the properties defined in the class and can perform the behaviors defined by the class

// example: dog its color and breed are properties
//barking and fetching are behaviors 

class Dog {
    // Properties
    String color;
    String breed;

    // Constructor
    Dog(String color, String breed) {
        this.color = color;
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    // Behavior
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }

    void fetch() {
        System.out.println("Fetching the ball!");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Dog class
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Brown", "Labrador");

        // Accessing properties
        System.out.println("My dog's color: " + myDog.color);
        System.out.println("My dog's breed: " + myDog.breed);

        // Calling behaviors
        myDog.bark();
        myDog.fetch();
    }
